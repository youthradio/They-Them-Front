      "Essay": "<p>\nHere are just a few of the messages I’ve heard people say about me -- that is to say, about those who don’t identify as male or female: I’m crazy. I’m confused. I’m ugly, gross, unlovable. I’m evil -- Satanic, actually. I ignore science and reason. I’m buying into a trend. I’m faking because I just want attention. I don’t even exist. \n\n</p> <p>\nI read these beliefs and assumptions in the dark, stinking depths of Twitter. I see them in quotes and think-pieces by doctors, journalists, judges, and elected officials. I hear them from strangers on the street.\n</p> <p>\nSometimes, they even come from inside.\n</p> <p>\nI only started identifying as nonbinary about a year ago. But ever since I hit puberty, it was obvious that the relationship I had to my body was different from my peers. When the girls at my school were getting in trouble for wearing tank-tops and shorts, I was trying to disappear underneath shapeless sweaters. I rejected everything stereotypically feminine because all that stuff made me uncomfortable. Since being a girl felt so wrong, I started pursuing what I thought was my only option: transitioning to male.\n</p> <p>\nJust before I left 8th grade, I cut my hair (even though I liked it long) and started going by Desmond so that I would be “under the radar” at my new high school. I wasn’t necessarily super masculine; I just understood myself to be a man. So starting freshman year, my confidence depended entirely on whether others understood me to be a man, too. \n</p> <p>\nRumors would still spread about me at school. Occasionally others asked me point-blank if I was transgender. And unless they were a nurse or a counselor, I said no. I was terrified that people would treat me differently because they’d think I was freaky and gross for being trans, largely because I felt freaky and gross myself. There were many mornings I couldn't bring myself to go to school because my dysphoria was too intense.\n</p> <p>\nInstead of seeking out friends who could empathize with this problem, I projected my own self-resentment onto other queers -- particularly transmasculine people who weren’t afraid to embrace “feminine” clothing and makeup. I almost found their presentation offensive, as if failing to fit seamlessly within the boundaries of conventional maleness undermined “authentic” transgender men. After all, why would someone go through the effort of coming out and transitioning if they don’t want to look or act like a guy? If everyone around them perceives them as a woman, what difference does it make how they identify? \n</p> <p>\nIn that spirit, I surrounded myself with straight, cisgender teenage boys who had no knowledge of my history. Their friendships allowed me to further distance myself from my transness, like bro camouflage. But I never felt able to tell them about what I was struggling with.\n</p> <p>Approaching my transition in this way was scary and isolating. I thought it would be liberating to escape the label of “trans” and the stigma it came with. But I was forcing myself into a strict, yet totally arbitrary standard of masculinity, thus letting other people determine who I was allowed to be. \n</p> <p>\nStill, it was hard to really internalize that manhood is constructed, nebulous, and flawed. It felt like admitting defeat, like having to accept that I would never be a “real man,” even though there was never any such thing in the first place.\n</p> <p>\nSurgery and hormones helped to relieve my gender dysphoria. Having a flat chest and a deeper voice meant I could wear whatever I wanted and still mostly be seen as male by others. But I was still clinging tightly to my insecurities-- that is, until the election of Donald Trump.\n</p> <p>\nAfter all the guilt I’d felt for admiring the rich colors and textures of the makeup in Seventeen magazine; the discomfort I swallowed because I hated using the restroom or taking off my jacket while at school; the fear that one day my best friends would learn that I was born different from them and ditch me… I suddenly became sick and tired of giving power to prejudice by letting my internalized transphobia dictate what I could say and do.\n</p> <p>\nAnd what surprised me is, I felt more comfortable exploring androgyny knowing I wouldn’t always be mistaken for a woman. Armed with make up, crop tops, glitter, nail polish, and jewelry, I started waging war on the beauty norms that limited me by reclaiming the space between male and female that had once been so scary to inhabit.\n</p> <p>\nDon’t get me wrong. There are still times when I wish my skin was clay, so I could sculpt away the feminine qualities I see in my face. But I present in the way that I do, in part, to spite my previous self: the one who was ashamed to “look trans.” \n</p>"

If anything the action figures made me gayer with a hint of body dysmorphia. I can’t fault them, though -- For parents, it’s easier to try to prepare your child for the world than to prepare the world for your child. But if their goal was to get me to buy into society’s gender roles, like “normal children,” it didn’t work. </p> \n \n<p><span class= 'p3text font-weight-bold bigger'>No shade, but all of this gender stuff seems like a scam, no matter how you do it or don't do it. </span></p> \n \n<p>When I walk into a store today and it says, boy’s, girl's, men's, or women's -- I can still shop anywhere in the store. Anyone can, if you aren't afraid to. But stores are selling us gender roles, and most of society is buying in. </p> \n \n<p>And I'm just trying to pay my bills. </p> \n \n<p>These days I’m finding labels to be very stressful. I feel like I don’t have a gender, but no matter what I wear I’m going to be seen as a man because of my body. But I don’t have to uphold expectations of what I should be wearing for my body, or who I should be 24/7.  </p> \n \n<p>It's really hard to pin down with words how I move in the world with so many people trying to stick labels on me-- from being told by family while growing up, that I had to be masculine to being told by the kids on the bus that I had “a little sugar in my bowl,” to being told by racists that dark skinned black bodies like mine are masculine by default. I’m even labeled by potential romantic partners that say I’m either “too feminine” or “not feminine enough.”</p> \n \n<p>All my life I’ve been told to toughen up, because racism requires black folks to have a tough skin, but I’ve always been “soft.” Part of me is sure that most nonbinary folks are empathic energies in a world that loves division -- division of genders, bodies, etc. <p class= 'p3text font-weight-bold bigger'> In an ideal world, by shedding labels I’d be able to shed the -isms that come with them.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I have to navigate a gender nonconforming body, a black body, and being assigned male at birth. I have to navigate how people think femininity is frivolous and the judgements they project onto me. </p> \n \n<p>If femininity were as frivolous as it is assumed to be on my body, then we’d expect femininity from no one -- and that’s part of the whole “gender is a scam” thing. Gender is a scam, but as long as society continues to buy into it, nonbinary folks will be treated like scammers. And honestly, I’m tired. </p> \n \n<p>I need a rest from intersectional mental gymnastics like America needs a rest from gender reveal parties.<p class= 'p3text font-weight-bold bigger'> I know that I get tired of being woke, and other people get tired of being woke and that we all need some rest.</p></p>"
