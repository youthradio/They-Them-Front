          <p>As a young child, I loved to dance. Sometimes I would swing my hips with a mood alight with sassiness. Other times I was more dominant, leading the routines of girls in duo dances, helping to guide them with my hands on their hips. When I danced, others would say the way I danced would change from being feminine to masculine, and sometimes both. When I felt like both, I would combine both of my dancing styles, sassy and dominant. </p>

<p>
Back then, I didn’t have the words for my gender identity, but it’s like my body always knew. </p>

<p>
I identify as genderfluid. Some days I may feel like a girl, other days a boy, somedays both but also neither. What gender fluid means to me is who I am and how I am feeling on any particular day.  Day to day, I might identify as a different gender, but my personality does not change. I feel more comfortable with they/them pronouns, and I feel that they/them pronouns are easier for others to address me. </p>

<p>
I’m comfortable with my gender identity, but sometimes it can feel like I’m the only one.  My family members and classmates refuse to call me by the right pronouns and disrespect my gender. </p>

<p>One day at home, while preparing to bind my chest, my mother walked over and said, “You know, on the days you say you’re a guy, you act really different from your normal girl self,” making it seem like my personality depends on my gender. I’ve always wanted to respond to my mother or family members, but they are my elders and I need to respect them. If I could, I would rip my head open to show them what this is doing to my mind, creating inner conflict with myself, large storms in my mind.</p>

<p>
One classmate in my homeroom told me, “If you have a vagina, you’re a female. If you have a penis, you’re a male. You have a vagina, so you’re a girl.” Another told me, “I’m not used to calling a girl a boy.” At this point my blood was boiling. I kept thinking, “I already have to deal with this at home, now I have to deal with it at school too?” I got up, ready to scream until I had lost my voice, but all I could do was slam my fists on the desk. No words would come out, like a flow of water blocked behind a dam. I asked the teacher to go to the bathroom and stormed out of the classroom.</p>

<p>
When people close to me deny who I am, my self-esteem drops down like a thermometer on a cold winter's day.  I don’t always show it externally, but inside I always ask myself the same question: “why should someone have to go through this?” In the past, I’ve tried ignoring who I am on the inside, denying my gender identity. I’d wear large amounts of makeup and a long fringe to hide what my face actually looked like. This put me in an extremely dark place. Learning from that place in my life, I’m trying to accept my true gender.  I now know, as much as I try, I can never change who I am. </p>


<p>I just wish the other people around me could understand what my brain and heart are telling me. One of my dreams is for my family and peers to address my pronouns correctly -- for people to understand that it’s not always just one or the other, it could be both or neither. I know I’m not the only one in this world going through this situation, but I know we can all fight this together, side by side.</p>
