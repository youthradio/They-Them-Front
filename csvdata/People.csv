Desmond,p1text,des.png,He/They,21,"""I present in the way that I do, in part, to spite my previous self: the one who was ashamed to 'look trans.'""","<p>
Here are just a few of the messages I’ve heard people say about me -- that is to say, about those who don’t identify as male or female: I’m crazy. I’m confused. I’m ugly, gross, unlovable. I’m evil -- Satanic, actually. I ignore science and reason. I’m buying into a trend. I’m faking because I just want attention. I don’t even exist. 

</p> <p>
I read these beliefs and assumptions in the dark, stinking depths of Twitter. I see them in quotes and think-pieces by doctors, journalists, judges, and elected officials. I hear them from strangers on the street.
</p> <p>
Sometimes, they even come from inside.
</p> <p>
I only started identifying as nonbinary about a year ago. But ever since I hit puberty, it was obvious that the relationship I had to my body was different from my peers. When the girls at my school were getting in trouble for wearing tank-tops and shorts, I was trying to disappear underneath shapeless sweaters. I rejected everything stereotypically feminine because all that stuff made me uncomfortable. Since being a girl felt so wrong, I started pursuing what I thought was my only option: transitioning to male.
</p> <p>
Just before I left 8th grade, I cut my hair (even though I liked it long) and started going by Desmond so that I would be “under the radar” at my new high school. I wasn’t necessarily super masculine; I just understood myself to be a man. So starting freshman year, my confidence depended entirely on whether others understood me to be a man, too. 
</p> <p>
Rumors would still spread about me at school. Occasionally others asked me point-blank if I was transgender. And unless they were a nurse or a counselor, I said no. I was terrified that people would treat me differently because they’d think I was freaky and gross for being trans, largely because I felt freaky and gross myself. There were many mornings I couldn't bring myself to go to school because my dysphoria was too intense.
</p> <p>
Instead of seeking out friends who could empathize with this problem, I projected my own self-resentment onto other queers -- particularly transmasculine people who weren’t afraid to embrace “feminine” clothing and makeup. I almost found their presentation offensive, as if failing to fit seamlessly within the boundaries of conventional maleness undermined “authentic” transgender men. After all, why would someone go through the effort of coming out and transitioning if they don’t want to look or act like a guy? If everyone around them perceives them as a woman, what difference does it make how they identify? 
</p> <p>
In that spirit, I surrounded myself with straight, cisgender teenage boys who had no knowledge of my history. Their friendships allowed me to further distance myself from my transness, like bro camouflage. But I never felt able to tell them about what I was struggling with.
</p> <p>Approaching my transition in this way was scary and isolating. I thought it would be liberating to escape the label of “trans” and the stigma it came with. But I was forcing myself into a strict, yet totally arbitrary standard of masculinity, thus letting other people determine who I was allowed to be. 
</p> <p>
Still, it was hard to really internalize that manhood is constructed, nebulous, and flawed. It felt like admitting defeat, like having to accept that I would never be a “real man,” even though there was never any such thing in the first place.
</p> <p>
Surgery and hormones helped to relieve my gender dysphoria. Having a flat chest and a deeper voice meant I could wear whatever I wanted and still mostly be seen as male by others. But I was still clinging tightly to my insecurities-- that is, until the election of Donald Trump.
</p> <p>
After all the guilt I’d felt for admiring the rich colors and textures of the makeup in Seventeen magazine; the discomfort I swallowed because I hated using the restroom or taking off my jacket while at school; the fear that one day my best friends would learn that I was born different from them and ditch me… I suddenly became sick and tired of giving power to prejudice by letting my internalized transphobia dictate what I could say and do.
</p> <p>
And what surprised me is, I felt more comfortable exploring androgyny knowing I wouldn’t always be mistaken for a woman. Armed with make up, crop tops, glitter, nail polish, and jewelry, I started waging war on the beauty norms that limited me by reclaiming the space between male and female that had once been so scary to inhabit.
</p> <p>
Don’t get me wrong. There are still times when I wish my skin was clay, so I could sculpt away the feminine qualities I see in my face. But I present in the way that I do, in part, to spite my previous self: the one who was ashamed to “look trans.”

Malia,p2text,mal.png,He/They,17,"""When I was 15, I told my mom that I preferred they/them pronouns. Her reaction was one of the better ones.""","<p dir=""ltr"">When I was a sophomore in high school, I announced to my Rainbow Alliance club that I wanted to change my pronouns from she/her to they/them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I almost didn&rsquo;t tell them because I was scared that they wouldn&rsquo;t accept me or make the change into a bigger deal than it was. These thoughts plagued me throughout the meeting, but eventually, I built up the courage to tell them. I slipped it into the announcements that occurred at the end of the meeting so that nobody would have the chance to interrogate me for more information.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But rather than make a big deal about it, my fellow club members simply nodded their heads and left to go to class.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When it came to me being non-binary, my peers &ldquo;got&rdquo; it. My parents... not so much.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Granted, nobody in my family ever thought that I was straight. When I was in elementary school and had to dress up for a recital, I chose a blue button-down shirt while my twin sister chose a frilly dress. My mom was supportive of my choices, paying for the shirt without protest. She never pressured me to dress or look a certain way as long as I appeared presentable.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given my love of sports and few female friends, I think my mom was convinced that I was just a really butch lesbian. My mom never talked to me about gender or sexuality -- she did this out of love; I know she wanted the best for me and was trying to show that she was in my corner. Still, it became clear that it was easier for her to be supportive of a kid who fit in a single gender box, whether that was boy or girl.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When I was 15, I told my mom that I preferred they/them pronouns. We were sitting at the kitchen table after dinner with my twin and older sister. I was young and naive. Growing up in the Bay Area had sheltered me, my hope of immediate acceptance was dashed when my mom responded to my request, saying that, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not grammatically correct.&rdquo;. Which was pretty unexpected for a woman who had let me express myself freely in a small town where judgment was a common pastime.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Her reaction was one of the better ones. My older sister argued that I was alienating the straight community by being so imposing and not showing enough &ldquo;compassion&rdquo;. Despite me telling my mom that I did not want to have the conversation with my dad, she sent him an e-mail anyway. He has never broached the subject with me, nor I with him. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;After that incident I was too scared to bring the topic up again; my family was uncomfortable with the subject and thought that I had gotten over it, that my pronouns were no longer an issue and that I didn&rsquo;t mind being referred to as a girl. They still refer to me as their sister and daughter, and each time I hide my cringing discomfort. At this point in my life, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s right. But I do know what&rsquo;s wrong. I&rsquo;m still the same person, but I am not their daughter.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It&rsquo;s been two years since my &ldquo;coming out&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve grown a lot since then. In the intervening time, I&rsquo;ve tried not to think about my gender identity. But now, as I&rsquo;m about to leave college, I&rsquo;m considering coming out again. I feel more comfortable being referred to as he/him than I do as she/her. While my uncertain story is unlike many visible trans stories, I&rsquo;ve learned that it is still as valid.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">My communities at school and work have always been supportive of my pronouns. I think that my family has evolved with their acceptance. I&rsquo;ve had several mini-coming out session with my twin sister where I give her updates on my journey to an identity. As for the rest of the family, they&rsquo;re trying. Especially my mom. I only wish that their effort translated into actual results. But for now, it seems as if I will have to comfort myself with their attitude rather than with their actions.</p>"
Paulina,p4text,pal.png,Paulina,17,"""It was a big shock to my best friend, four years into our friendship, when I came out as non-binary.""","<p> I’m non-binary, but that doesn’t mean I like it when my best friend calls me “it.” Even though I tell her that it's offensive, and that I don't like it, she continues to do so. </p>

<p>For the first few years while I was figuring out my gender identity, I kept my confusion and struggle to myself. I was afraid to tell others because I didn’t know how to explain that I didn’t feel like a girl and I didn’t think anyone would be able to understand. I was alone in my own world. </p>

<p>So it was a big shock to my best friend, four years into our friendship, when I came out as non-binary. I remember explaining non-binary as not female, and not male. </p>

<p>Her reply was “Oh, so you’re an it?”  </p>
 
<p>I was heartbroken. It had taken me a lot of breakdowns, soul searching, and self-validation to identify a gender I was comfortable with. And she just keeps doing it.</p>

<p><span class=""p4text font-weight-bold bigger"">Every time my friend calls me “it,” even as a joke, it feels like she is betraying my trust. </span> </p>

<p>I remember a time she yelled at me, ""Shut up, you're a girl!"" </p>

<p>Perplexed and hurt, I defended myself. ""What are you talking about? No I'm not."" I began to re-explain myself to her.</p>

<p>She interrupted. “Yeah, I know.” Then, she dropped the conversation. </p>


<p>Despite her ignorance, I won't end our friendship. We met as seventh graders and have helped each other grow. As a kid, I was moody, rude, and obnoxious. I had a big mouth and would say whatever was on my mind, especially if it was to judge someone else. Yet, she saw past that and appreciated me for who I was. Even when I pushed her away, she stuck to me like peanut butter. </p>


<p>If it wasn’t for her, I would still be a brat. That’s why I value her so much, but that’s also why it hurts that she can’t understand my gender identity. Or if she does, she doesn’t get that it’s not something I want her to joke about. </p>


<p>I want to have a sit-down conservation with her and say, “Whether you understand my gender identity or not, I feel disrespected and hurt when you call me ‘it.’ I feel like a foreign object, something that doesn’t belong, when you call me that. I’ve had people insult me using ‘it.’ There is nothing endearing about the word. <span class=""p4text font-weight-bold""> I’m not asking, I’m demanding you stop using that word.</span>”  </p>


<p>I haven’t had the opportunity to have that talk with her yet, but I wish I didn’t have to have a conversation with her at all. I don’t like having to question where her mindset is. After all, she’s my best friend. She should have been taking me seriously from the start.</p>


<p>When we’re just hanging out, it’s not something I’m usually thinking about. It’s only when she says something ignorant that I have to wonder, <span class=""p4text font-weight-bold"">“Damn. Is that really how you feel?” </span>  </p>"
Jen,p3text,jen.png,She/He/They,24,"""Gender is a scam.""","<p>
I used to carry a doll as a child, I don’t know much about the doll -- just that my parents thought dolls would make me gay and action figures wouldn’t, which was way off. If anything the action figures made me gayer with a hint of body dysmorphia. I can’t fault them, though -- For parents, it’s easier to try to prepare your child for the world than to prepare the world for your child. But if their goal was to get me to buy into society’s gender roles, like “normal children,” it didn’t work. </p> 
 
<p><span class= 'p3text font-weight-bold bigger'>No shade, but all of this gender stuff seems like a scam, no matter how you do it or don't do it. </span></p> 
 
<p>When I walk into a store today and it says, boy’s, girl's, men's, or women's -- I can still shop anywhere in the store. Anyone can, if you aren't afraid to. But stores are selling us gender roles, and most of society is buying in. </p> 
 
<p>And I'm just trying to pay my bills. </p> 
 
<p>These days I’m finding labels to be very stressful. I feel like I don’t have a gender, but no matter what I wear I’m going to be seen as a man because of my body. But I don’t have to uphold expectations of what I should be wearing for my body, or who I should be 24/7.  </p> 
 
<p>It's really hard to pin down with words how I move in the world with so many people trying to stick labels on me-- from being told by family while growing up, that I had to be masculine to being told by the kids on the bus that I had “a little sugar in my bowl,” to being told by racists that dark skinned black bodies like mine are masculine by default. I’m even labeled by potential romantic partners that say I’m either “too feminine” or “not feminine enough.”</p> 
 
<p>All my life I’ve been told to toughen up, because racism requires black folks to have a tough skin, but I’ve always been “soft.” Part of me is sure that most nonbinary folks are empathic energies in a world that loves division -- division of genders, bodies, etc. <p class= 'p3text font-weight-bold bigger'> In an ideal world, by shedding labels I’d be able to shed the -isms that come with them.</p>

<p>Instead, I have to navigate a gender nonconforming body, a black body, and being assigned male at birth. I have to navigate how people think femininity is frivolous and the judgements they project onto me. </p> 
 
<p>If femininity were as frivolous as it is assumed to be on my body, then we’d expect femininity from no one -- and that’s part of the whole “gender is a scam” thing. Gender is a scam, but as long as society continues to buy into it, nonbinary folks will be treated like scammers. And honestly, I’m tired. </p> 
 
<p>I need a rest from intersectional mental gymnastics like America needs a rest from gender reveal parties.<p class= 'p3text font-weight-bold bigger'> I know that I get tired of being woke, and other people get tired of being woke and that we all need some rest.</p></p>
