Desmond,p1text,des.svg,He/They,21,"""I present in the way that I do, in part, to spite my previous self: the one who was ashamed to 'look trans.' ""","<p dir=""ltr"">Here are just a few of the messages I&rsquo;ve heard about who I am-- that is to say, about people who don&rsquo;t identify as male or female: I&rsquo;m crazy. I&rsquo;m confused. I&rsquo;m ugly, gross, unlovable. I&rsquo;m a pervert. I&rsquo;m evil-- Satanic, actually. I hate everything straight and cisgender, especially men. I don&rsquo;t deserve the same support as binary transmen and transwomen. I&rsquo;m stupid. I ignore science and reason. I need to face reality. I&rsquo;m buying into a trend. I&rsquo;m faking because I just want attention. I don&rsquo;t even exist.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sometimes these beliefs and assumptions come from random, faceless accounts in the dark, stinking depths of Twitter. Sometimes they are in the form of unsolicited comments from strangers on the street. Sometimes they come from quotes and think-pieces written by doctors, journalists, judges, even elected officials.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sometimes they come from inside.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When I entered middle school, it became clear to me that the relationship I had with my body was different from my peers. The girls in my school were getting in trouble for wearing tank-tops and shorts, while I tried to disappear underneath shapeless sweaters. I rejected everything stereotypically feminine. Instead, I realized, I related to masculinity in a way that was not really socially acceptable for females.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I started transitioning just before I left 8th grade so that I would be &ldquo;under the radar&rdquo; at my new high school. I cut my hair, even though I liked having long hair, and started going by Desmond. I wasn&rsquo;t super masculine, per se. But I was very rigid in my gender identity, and I tried to distance myself from transness as much as possible.</p>
<p>At that time, passing as male was the foundation of my confidence. There were many mornings I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to be seen at school because I couldn&rsquo;t make myself look passable enough. I didn&rsquo;t understand that functionally, I was letting other people determine who I was allowed to be.</p>
<p>Despite my efforts, people at my high school occasionally asked me point-blank if I was transgender. And unless they were a nurse or a counselor, I said no. I was terrified that people would bully me or avoid me because they&rsquo;d think I was freaky and gross for being trans. I mean, even I kind of thought I was freaky and gross.</p>
<p>One element of that was harboring resentment towards other queers-- especially transmasculine people who weren&rsquo;t afraid to embrace &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; clothing and makeup. I thought that failing to fit seamlessly within the boundaries of conventional masculine presentation undermined the masculinity (read: dignity) of &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; transgender men. After all, why even transition if you don&rsquo;t want to look or act like a guy? In that spirit, I surrounded myself with a brand new group of friends: straight, cisgender teenage boys who had no knowledge of my history. It was like bro camouflage.</p>
<p>Even after I transitioned, my internalized cissexism led me to suppress parts of myself that my culture labels as inappropriate for my gender. I can&rsquo;t point to one single, decisive moment when this dawned on me, but I can point to all the guilt I felt for admiring the rich colors and textures of the makeup in Seventeen magazine; the discomfort I swallowed because I hated using the restroom or taking off my jacket while at school; the fear that one day my best friends would learn that I was born different from them and ditch me.</p>
<p>Surgery and hormones went a long way towards relieving my passing anxiety. Having a flat chest and a deeper voice meant I didn&rsquo;t have to obsess over my appearance in order to be treated the way I wanted to be treated. More than ever, I was at peace with the body I saw in the mirror. That newfound security opened me up, and, armed with makeup, crop tops, glitter, nail polish, and jewelry, I started waging war on the beauty norms that had caused me so much pain.</p>
<p>Chipping away at the transphobia, cissexism, and misogyny I&rsquo;ve internalized over my life has been a long process that I&rsquo;m not through with yet. There are times when I wish my skin was clay so I could sculpt away the feminine qualities I see in my face. How can I not, when people feel entitled to comment on my appearance when I look androgynous in public? When nearly every media depiction of love and beauty-- even in queer culture-- revolves around cissexist and binarist standards? When journalists treat me like the product of a youth trend gone overboard rather than a part of a group that faces widespread yet virtually unaddressed social and political discrimination?</p>
<p>When I started transitioning, it was in the hopes of becoming a person worth being. But being a &ldquo;real man&rdquo; is just not important to me the way it was six years ago. It&rsquo;s standing inside of an imaginary blue box rather than an imaginary pink one. In the end, I can only be myself: complex, flawed, and worth being no matter what. So I choose to present in the way that I do, in part, to spite the past version of myself who was ashamed to &ldquo;look trans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have to be vigilant in reminding myself that the negative messages directed at people like me have no inherent power. They are neither new nor original. They are things I have been given, things I never asked for, things I&rsquo;m slowly letting go of.</p>

Malia,p2text,mal.svg,He/They,17,"""When I was 15, I told my mom that I preferred they/them pronouns. Her reaction was one of the better ones. "" ","<p dir=""ltr"">When I was a sophomore in high school, I announced to my Rainbow Alliance club that I wanted to change my pronouns from she/her to they/them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I almost didn&rsquo;t tell them because I was scared that they wouldn&rsquo;t accept me or make the change into a bigger deal than it was. These thoughts plagued me throughout the meeting, but eventually, I built up the courage to tell them. I slipped it into the announcements that occurred at the end of the meeting so that nobody would have the chance to interrogate me for more information.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But rather than make a big deal about it, my fellow club members simply nodded their heads and left to go to class.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When it came to me being non-binary, my peers &ldquo;got&rdquo; it. My parents... not so much.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Granted, nobody in my family ever thought that I was straight. When I was in elementary school and had to dress up for a recital, I chose a blue button-down shirt while my twin sister chose a frilly dress. My mom was supportive of my choices, paying for the shirt without protest. She never pressured me to dress or look a certain way as long as I appeared presentable.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given my love of sports and few female friends, I think my mom was convinced that I was just a really butch lesbian. My mom never talked to me about gender or sexuality -- she did this out of love; I know she wanted the best for me and was trying to show that she was in my corner. Still, it became clear that it was easier for her to be supportive of a kid who fit in a single gender box, whether that was boy or girl.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When I was 15, I told my mom that I preferred they/them pronouns. We were sitting at the kitchen table after dinner with my twin and older sister. I was young and naive. Growing up in the Bay Area had sheltered me, my hope of immediate acceptance was dashed when my mom responded to my request, saying that, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not grammatically correct.&rdquo;. Which was pretty unexpected for a woman who had let me express myself freely in a small town where judgment was a common pastime.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Her reaction was one of the better ones. My older sister argued that I was alienating the straight community by being so imposing and not showing enough &ldquo;compassion&rdquo;. Despite me telling my mom that I did not want to have the conversation with my dad, she sent him an e-mail anyway. He has never broached the subject with me, nor I with him. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;After that incident I was too scared to bring the topic up again; my family was uncomfortable with the subject and thought that I had gotten over it, that my pronouns were no longer an issue and that I didn&rsquo;t mind being referred to as a girl. They still refer to me as their sister and daughter, and each time I hide my cringing discomfort. At this point in my life, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s right. But I do know what&rsquo;s wrong. I&rsquo;m still the same person, but I am not their daughter.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It&rsquo;s been two years since my &ldquo;coming out&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve grown a lot since then. In the intervening time, I&rsquo;ve tried not to think about my gender identity. But now, as I&rsquo;m about to leave college, I&rsquo;m considering coming out again. I feel more comfortable being referred to as he/him than I do as she/her. While my uncertain story is unlike many visible trans stories, I&rsquo;ve learned that it is still as valid.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">My communities at school and work have always been supportive of my pronouns. I think that my family has evolved with their acceptance. I&rsquo;ve had several mini-coming out session with my twin sister where I give her updates on my journey to an identity. As for the rest of the family, they&rsquo;re trying. Especially my mom. I only wish that their effort translated into actual results. But for now, it seems as if I will have to comfort myself with their attitude rather than with their actions.</p>"
