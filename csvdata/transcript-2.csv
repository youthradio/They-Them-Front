0:00:00,0:00:06,Do you find being gender nonconforming makes dating or approaching romantic relationships--,,,
0:00:06,0:00:11,,,Definitely! You don't even need to finish the sentence!,
0:00:11,0:00:37,,,,"Dating as a femme person for me just makes dating even more ridiculous in my body. It's like, cuz I tend to like bodies that are reflections of mine, it's hard to choose a label. Like am I gay? Am I pan? Am I bi? What am I doing? What do people who date me do? Because sometimes I'm like, our bodies complicate our labels and our labels complicate our bodies."
0:00:38,0:00:48,,,"I feel way more comfortable with dating people who say they're pansexual, because it's like, no matter what I identify [as], either way, like they would love me for who I am.",
0:00:49,0:00:59,,,,I can almost only date online. And no one who's dating online is typically looking to date online. They're typically looking to hook up one time and never see you again
0:00:59,0:01:29,,,"For me, I feel like it's really frustrating, especially because... all around me, all there is is cisgender straight guys, and so like, when I start talking to one of them, I have to be like, hey, you got to realize nonbinary. And then I'm thinking in my head: Do they really think this way? Like, are they even considering that? Do they still-- Do they still see me or think of me as a girl, despite what I say? So that worries me a lot. A lot, a lot.",
0:01:29,,,,,"Being a person who is very visibly queer to people... When people are afraid to date me, but call themselves ""real men,"" and they have this whole schema of a real man as like a confident person who is doing the best for society-- I'm like, how can you be attracted to me, and say that you want something real, but then be afraid to date me in public? That's about the only thing. Like, it's not like people think I'm ugly. It's not like I'm not getting any play! But I want to sit down with one person and not do this Bay Area polyamorous stuff."
