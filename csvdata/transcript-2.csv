0:00:00,0:00:18,"I remember when I was younger and I was dealing with all sorts of like trans-y feelings, I struggled a lot with the idea that no one would ever want to get to know me well enough to understand that thing that's inside because they'd judge me. You know, no one would think I was cute. And anyone who did think I was cute wouldn't just see me as like a normal person.

0:00:19,0:00:30,,,,"Dating as a femme person, for me, just makes dating even more ridiculous in my body. Because I tend to like bodies that are reflections of mine, it's hard to choose a label.
"
0:00:30,0:00:41,,,,"Like, am I gay? Am I pan? Am I bi? What am I doing? What do people who date me do? Our bodies complicate our labels and our labels complicate our bodies.

0:00:42,0:00:54,,,"I feel way more comfortable with dating people who say they're pansexual because it's like, no matter what I identify [as] they will love me for who I am. But it's really difficult.",
0:00:56,0:01:17,,,"All around me all there is is cisgender straight guys, and so when I start talking to one of them I have to be like, ""Hey, you gotta realize, I'm non-binary."" And then I'm thinking in my head, ""Do they really think this way?"" Like, are they even considering that? Do they still mean it? Do they still see me, or think of me, as a girl despite what I say?

0:01:33,0:01:41,"They just see a face and they see ""they/them"" and if I don't like the way that they're interacting with me, I don't have to interact with them. I can just ignore them.",,,
0:01:42,0:01:52,,,,"I can almost only date online. And like, no one who's dating online is typically looking to *date* online. They're typically looking to hook up one time and never see you again.

0:01:53,0:02:14,,,,"When people are afraid to date me, I'm like, ""How can you be attracted to me and say that you want something real, but then be afraid to date me in public?"" That's about the only thing. It's not like people think I'm ugly. it's not like I'm not getting play. But I want to sit down with one person and not do this Bay Area polyamorous stuff. LOL
