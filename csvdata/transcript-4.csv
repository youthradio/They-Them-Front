0:00:00,0:00:21,,,"I never technically came out to my family as being nonbinary. I just kind of started rejecting the words ""daughter"" and ""female."" My mom, she was she was really confused, like, ""What is this Paulina? What are you talking about?"" And I was just like, ""Well, you know there's boy and there's girl, right? She's like, ""Yeah."" And I was like, ""OK, well I'm neither.""",

0:00:32,0:00:49,,"I came out to my mom two years ago. I was 15 and I didn't really explain much. I was like, ""Oh, I want to use they/them pronouns."" And the immediate thing was like, ""That's not grammatically correct."" And I was like, ""Hmmm..."" Then I got an hour lecture from my older sister about how I wasn't being compassionate enough for other people, and how I wasn't recognizing how difficult it may be for them.",,
0:00:50,0:01:09,"I did come out as male first, and I transitioned. And then I came to realize that, maybe at one point it was a good word to describe what I was, but now it's not quite fitting. I've never talked to my parents about my being nonbinary. As far as I know they still use masculine words in order to refer to me, and that's fine. I don't really much care about that.",,,
0:01:10,0:01:29,"But with people whom I have told and talked to and they choose to ignore me... It's frustrating. You know, while I don't want to be reminding them over and over again, and I don't particularly feel comfortable doing that even once, I don't want to give them permission to be ignorant.",,,
0:01:30,0:01:43,,,"My best friend... She likes calling me ""it"" even though I tell her that it's offensive and that I don't like it. But she continues to do it. I wouldn't end my friendship with her over it but, you know, it hurts. It hurts that she doesn't understand.",
0:01:44,0:02:01,,"So I got this job at a cafe, right? I've been working there for like two weeks, and everybody was referring to me as she/her. And then after two weeks, somebody came up to me and was like, ""What are your pronouns?"" And I was like, I don't want to say anything. It just creates so many questions, and I don't like people being like, ""Why didn't you tell me before?""",,
0:02:02,0:02:16,,,,My family loves and supports me. I used to think they didn't because they would say things they were ignorant. And I don't think they necessarily prepared the world for me as much as they were trying to prepare me for the world.
