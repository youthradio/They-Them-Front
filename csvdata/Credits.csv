"<p>In Their Own Words was produced by outLoud, a project of Youth Radio that amplifies the voices of LGBTQ+ young people.</p> <p>In Their Own Words focuses on the perspectives of four young, non-binary individuals. It is not meant to represent the views or experiences of all non-binary people.</p>

<h3> Terms </h3>
 <p> The words we use to talk about gender and identity are always evolving. Some people may use these terms slightly differently than others, and the meanings of these words may shift in the future. And it’s very personal. Don’t assume you know how someone identifies before you use a word to describe them. </p>
<p> <strong>Non-binary: </strong>(adjective) Describes someone whose gender identity isn’t “man” or “woman.” That does not make them an “it.” Non-binary people can be masculine, feminine, both, or neither in appearance or behavior. Gender identities that are non-binary include genderqueer, agender, genderfluid, transmasculine/transfeminine, and others, but these words are not interchangeable with the word non-binary.</p>

<p><strong>Transgender:</strong> (adjective) Describes someone whose gender identity does not correspond with their expected gender based on their sex at birth. Often this term refers to someone with a binary gender identity -- that is, a man or a woman. Some non-binary people also identify as transgender, but others see this as a separate identity.</p>

<p><strong>Cisgender:</strong> (adjective) Describes someone whose gender identity corresponds with their expected gender based on their sex at birth. For example, a man who was assigned male at birth (see below) would be cisgender.</p>

<p><strong>Trans:</strong> (adjective) Originally a shortening of the word transgender, trans has become its own umbrella term that describes those who are not cisgender. The term is often used by people who are transgender as well as people who are non-binary.</p>

<p><strong>Assigned male/female at birth:</strong> Generally, instead of saying someone is “born” or “biologically” male or female, trans people say they are assigned male or female at birth to emphasize that these are socially constructed categories based on sex. Often abbreviated to <strong>AMAB </strong>or <strong>AFAB</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Transmasculine:</strong> (adjective) Describes someone who is trans and AFAB.</p>

<p><strong>Transfeminine: </strong>(adjective) Describes someone who is trans and AMAB.</p>

<p><strong>Queer:</strong> (adjective/noun) A old-school slur that was reclaimed as a catch-all term to describe non-normative gender identity and sexuality. People who identify as queer often do so because they find other labels limiting, confusing, or not meaningful.</p>

<p><strong>Pansexual:</strong> (adjective) Attracted to people based on their personalities, without regard for their sex or gender. </p>
